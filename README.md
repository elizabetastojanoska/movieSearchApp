# Movie Search App with Favorites

This is a simple movie search application where users can search for movies using the TMDB API and add them to their favorites list. The favorites are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to persist their favorite movies even after closing the browser.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title.
- **Add to Favorites**: Add movies to a favorites list.
- **View Favorite Movies**: View the list of movies that have been added to favorites.
- **Persistent Favorites**: Favorites are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to see them across sessions.
- **Movie Details**: Show a short description, release date, and a poster for each movie.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the app (Bootstrap for responsive design).
- **JavaScript**: To handle the logic for movie search, displaying movies, and managing favorites.
- **PHP**: To act as a proxy between the API and the frontend part
- **TMDB API**: To fetch movie data such as title, description, poster, and release date.
- **Local Storage**: To store and retrieve the user's favorite movies.

### 4. API Key
To fetch movie data from TMDB, youâ€™ll need a TMDB API key.

## How It Works
# Movie Search:

The user enters a search query (movie title) in the search box.
The app fetches movies matching the query from the TMDB API.
Movies are displayed with their poster, title, release date, and a short description.
Adding to Favorites:

Each movie has an "Add to Favorites" button.
When clicked, the movie is added to the browsers local storage.

# Persistent Data:

Favorite movies persist between browser sessions using local storage.
Users can close and reopen the app, and their favorites will still be available.

### How to Add a Movie to Favorites
- Search for a movie by typing its title in the search box.
- Click the "Add to Favorites" button under the movie's details.
- The movie will be saved in the browser's local storage.
